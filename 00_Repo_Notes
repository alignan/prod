* Toolchain:

The focus is on getting the new toolchain verified.  As such this repo is
intended to be tested using new toolchain (mspgcc 4.4.5, uniarch, ti headers).

Some testing with the old 3.2.3 toolchain (original tinyos and z1 varient) has
also been done for simple function (ie. does it compile).


* Repo Structure

The msp430.git repo is located at:

git clone ssh://hinrg.cs.jhu.edu/home/cire/msp430.git  (r/w)
git clone git://hinrg.cs.jhu.edu/git/cire/msp430.git   (read-only)

The msp430.git repo tracks the hinrg t2 git repo which in turn imports from the
main svn T2 trunk.

* Branches:

master: is the main branch coming from the svn t2 mainline.  Updated manually.

master-vhsb: (vogon hyper-spatial bypass)  Bypass the Z1 commits on the main
	trunk.  This branch tracks master but has the superfluous Z1 commit
	removed as it conflicts with the collapsed msp430 x2xxx work done in
	mm_core.  This collapsage forms the majority of the work of merging
	the trees and there isn't much sense in reinventing the wheel.

msp430-int: main consolidation branch for the msp430 core.   It represents the
	current released version of the branch.

       includes all three major families (x1, x2, and x5).  Major cpu dependancies
       held in tos/chips/msp430/{x1xxx,x2xxx,x5xxx}

z1-pu: working directory for Zolertia modifications.   From verification of mm-z1
       combined tree.



To pull a working branch do the following:

    cd ~/mm							# make sure at top level, we call it mm
    git clone git://hinrg.cs.jhu.edu/git/cire/msp430.git	# grab from ro place
    cd msp430
    git config --add push.default matching	# make sure only existing branches get pushed.
						# only effects rw repos
    git checkout -t origin/msp430-int		# tracking branch, will be on msp430-int when done
    git checkout -b work			# local working branch
