Had to add this couple of lines:

       at start of operation:
       atomic P5OUT |= 0x06;

       when failure detected:
       atomic P5OUT &= ~0x06;
       atomic P5REN &= ~0x06;

I don't know WHY the data line was held low by the AMC6821 IC, but it sux, so I had to pull down both the lines (SCLK and DATA), as the I2C bus pulls the REN again, this worked, enabled the system to recover from this issue.

Not a clean fix, but a fix.

TO-DO:

- Using the logical analyzer, see if the IC is holding back the ACK from an incomplete write operation.
- Maybe I miss to add some more pull-up resistors to the open-drain pins of the AMC6821
